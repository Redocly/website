## Lesson 1: Introduction to API Testing

**What is API Testing?**

API testing is the practice of verifying that your APIs behave exactly as documented and expected. Unlike traditional testing that focuses on user interfaces, API testing validates the data exchange, functionality, reliability, performance, and security of application programming interfaces.

**Why API Testing Matters**

Modern applications rely heavily on APIs to connect services, share data, and enable integrations. When APIs don't work as expected, it can lead to:

- ❌ **Broken integrations** - Third-party services fail to connect
- ❌ **Data inconsistencies** - Incorrect or malformed responses
- ❌ **Security vulnerabilities** - Unauthorized access or data leaks
- ❌ **Poor user experience** - Application features that don't work
- ❌ **Lost revenue** - Failed transactions and customer churn

**Types of API Testing**

```yaml
API Testing Types:
  Contract Testing:
    - Validates API responses match OpenAPI specifications
    - Ensures backward compatibility
    - Catches breaking changes early
  
  Workflow Testing:
    - Tests multi-step API interactions
    - Validates complex business processes
    - Ensures data flows correctly between steps
  
  Performance Testing:
    - Measures response times and throughput
    - Identifies bottlenecks and scaling issues
    - Validates under load conditions
  
  Security Testing:
    - Validates authentication and authorization
    - Tests for common vulnerabilities
    - Ensures data protection
```

**The Redocly Approach**

Redocly Respect takes an **OpenAPI-first approach** to API testing. By using your existing OpenAPI specifications as the source of truth, Respect can automatically:

- Generate test cases from your API documentation
- Validate responses against defined schemas
- Test complex workflows described in Arazzo files
- Monitor APIs in production for drift and regressions

## Quick Start

If you want to jump straight into testing:

1. Install the Redocly CLI: `npm install -g @redocly/cli`
2. Generate tests from your OpenAPI spec: `npx @redocly/cli respect generate`
3. Run your first tests: `npx @redocly/cli respect run`
