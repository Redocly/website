# API Testing Use Cases

This guide explores common scenarios where API testing with Respect provides significant value. Learn how to apply API testing techniques to real-world situations and improve your API reliability.

## 1. Contract Testing

**Scenario:** Ensure your API implementation matches its OpenAPI specification.

### The Problem
Your API documentation says one thing, but your implementation does another. This leads to:
- Integration failures for consuming applications
- Confusion for developers trying to use your API
- Support tickets and debugging time

### The Solution
Contract testing validates that your API responses match your OpenAPI specification exactly.

```bash
# Test all endpoints against OpenAPI spec
redocly respect run --mode contract

# Example output:
✅ GET /users - Schema validation passed
❌ POST /users - Expected 201, got 200
❌ GET /user/{id} - Missing required field 'email' in response
```

### Implementation Tips
- Run contract tests in CI/CD for every code change
- Test both success and error responses
- Validate response headers, not just body content
- Use realistic test data that matches your schema constraints

---

## 2. Regression Testing

**Scenario:** Catch API changes that break existing functionality.

### The Problem
Code changes inadvertently break existing API behavior:
- Response schemas change unexpectedly
- Status codes are modified
- Required fields are removed
- Breaking changes are deployed without notice

### The Solution
Automated regression testing catches changes before they reach production.

```yaml
# respect.config.yaml - Regression testing setup
regression:
  baseline: tests/baseline-responses.json
  alertOnChanges:
    - status_code
    - response_schema
    - required_fields
```

### Best Practices
- Maintain a baseline of expected responses
- Test critical user journeys regularly
- Set up alerts for any specification changes
- Version your API specifications alongside code

---

## 3. Development Environment Testing

**Scenario:** Test APIs during local development.

### The Problem
Developers want to verify their changes work correctly before committing code, but manual testing is:
- Time-consuming and repetitive
- Prone to human error
- Difficult to cover all edge cases
- Hard to test error conditions

### The Solution
Local development testing with instant feedback.

```bash
# Watch mode for development
redocly respect run --watch --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Test specific endpoints while developing
redocly respect run tests/users.test.yaml --verbose
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make code changes to your API
2. Respect automatically detects changes
3. Tests run and provide immediate feedback
4. Fix issues before committing code

## 4. Third-Party API Validation

**Scenario:** Ensure external APIs you depend on work as expected.

### The Problem
Your application relies on third-party APIs that can:
- Change without notice
- Return unexpected data formats
- Have intermittent availability issues
- Break your application when they fail

### The Solution
Monitor and validate third-party APIs continuously.

```yaml
# External API monitoring
external_apis:
  - name: payment_provider
    spec: external/stripe-api.yaml
    base_url: https://api.stripe.com/v1
    schedule: "*/15 * * * *"  # Every 15 minutes
    
  - name: user_service
    spec: external/auth0-api.yaml
    base_url: https://dev-company.auth0.com/api/v2
    schedule: "0 */6 * * *"   # Every 6 hours
```

### Monitoring Strategy
- Test critical endpoints you depend on
- Set up alerts for failures or changes
- Maintain fallback strategies for API failures
- Document SLA expectations

---

## 5. Multi-Service Integration Testing

**Scenario:** Test workflows that span multiple microservices.

### The Problem
Modern applications often involve complex workflows that:
- Span multiple services and APIs
- Require specific sequencing of operations
- Depend on data flowing correctly between services
- Are difficult to test comprehensively

### The Solution
Workflow testing using Arazzo specifications.

```yaml
# arazzo-workflow.yaml
arazzo: 1.0.0
info:
  title: User Registration Workflow
  version: 1.0.0

workflows:
  - workflowId: complete_user_registration
    steps:
      - stepId: create_user
        operationId: createUser
        outputs:
          user_id: $response.body.id
          
      - stepId: send_welcome_email
        operationId: sendEmail
        parameters:
          user_id: $steps.create_user.outputs.user_id
          template: welcome
          
      - stepId: setup_billing
        operationId: createBillingAccount
        parameters:
          user_id: $steps.create_user.outputs.user_id
```

Run the workflow test:
```bash
redocly respect arazzo-workflow.yaml --input email=test@example.com
```

---

## 6. Performance and Load Testing

**Scenario:** Validate API performance under various conditions.

### The Problem
APIs need to perform well under load, but performance issues like:
- Slow response times under load
- Memory leaks that degrade performance
- Rate limiting that blocks legitimate requests
- Database query optimization needs

### The Solution
Performance testing integrated with functional testing.

```yaml
# performance-tests.yaml
performance:
  scenarios:
    - name: normal_load
      duration: 5m
      users: 10
      ramp_up: 30s
      
    - name: stress_test
      duration: 2m
      users: 100
      ramp_up: 10s
      
  thresholds:
    response_time_95th: 500ms
    error_rate: 1%
    throughput_min: 100rps
```

---

## 7. Security Testing

**Scenario:** Validate API security controls and authentication.

### The Problem
API security vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Unauthorized data access
- Data breaches and compliance violations
- Injection attacks and data corruption
- Authentication bypass

### The Solution
Automated security testing as part of your API test suite.

```yaml
# security-tests.yaml
security:
  authentication:
    - test: "Reject requests without valid token"
      endpoint: /api/users
      expect: 401
      
    - test: "Accept requests with valid token"
      endpoint: /api/users
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${valid_token}"
      expect: 200
      
  authorization:
    - test: "Prevent access to other user's data"
      endpoint: /api/users/123/private
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${user_456_token}"
      expect: 403
```
