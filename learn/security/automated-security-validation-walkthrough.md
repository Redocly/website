# Automated API Security Validation - Interactive Walkthrough

*Transform your API security from manual reviews to automated enforcement using production-ready validation rules.*

---

## What You'll Learn

This interactive walkthrough guides you through implementing **automated security validation** that enforces the **OWASP API Security Top 10 2023** using Redocly's validation engine. By the end, you'll have a complete security ruleset that prevents vulnerabilities before they reach production.

**You'll master:**
- Setting up comprehensive security validation rules
- Automating OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 compliance
- Implementing custom security validation functions
- Integrating security checks into CI/CD pipelines
- Troubleshooting common validation issues

## Security Validation Foundation

{% step id="basic-setup" heading="Basic Security Configuration" when={"approach": "basic"} %}

The basic configuration provides essential security rules for getting started with API validation:

- **Core Security Rules**: Ensures security schemes are defined
- **Response Validation**: Requires proper HTTP response codes
- **Built-in Protections**: Leverages Redocly's built-in security checks

This starter configuration is perfect for teams new to automated security validation.

{% /step %}

{% step id="api-example" heading="Example API Specification" when={"approach": "complete"} %}

This example OpenAPI specification demonstrates proper security implementation following validation best practices:

**Security Best Practices:**
- HTTPS-only server URLs
- UUID-based IDs to prevent enumeration
- Comprehensive security schemes with JWT/OAuth2
- Proper input validation with string length limits
- Rate limiting headers in all responses
- Complete error response definitions
- `additionalProperties: false` to prevent mass assignment

Use this as a reference when implementing your own secure APIs.

## Implementation Strategy

Implementing automated security validation is an iterative process. Here's a recommended approach:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Implement basic built-in rules
- Set up HTTPS enforcement and basic authentication checks
- Integrate into CI/CD pipeline with warning-level severity

**Phase 2: Core Security (Weeks 3-4)**
- Add input validation and resource consumption rules
- Implement mass assignment prevention
- Escalate critical rules to error-level severity

## Next Steps and Resources

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Download the configuration files** using the code walkthrough above
2. **Start with basic approach** if you're new to API security validation
3. **Test in development** before enforcing in production
4. **Customize rules** based on your specific security requirements
