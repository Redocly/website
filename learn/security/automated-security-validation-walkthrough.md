# Automated API Security Validation - Interactive Walkthrough

*Learn how validation rules can complement your existing security practices by catching common issues during development.*

---

## What You'll Learn

This walkthrough demonstrates one approach to implementing **automated security validation** that can help identify some common API security issues from the **OWASP API Security Top 10 2023** using validation rules. This complements other essential security practices like [TLS encryption](api-tls-encryption-https-best-practices), [input validation](api-input-validation-injection-prevention), [rate limiting](api-rate-limiting-abuse-prevention), and [access control](authentication-authorization-openapi). This is just one part of a comprehensive security strategy.

**You'll explore:**
- Setting up basic security validation rules for OpenAPI specifications
- Examples of how validation can catch [common security issues](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#attack-prevention-strategies) like mass assignment and injection attacks
- Custom validation function patterns you might adapt for your needs
- Options for integrating validation checks into development workflows
- Common troubleshooting scenarios when working with validation tools

## Security Validation Foundation

{% step id="basic-setup" heading="Basic Security Configuration" when={"approach": "basic"} %}

The basic configuration provides essential security rules for getting started with API validation:

- **Core Security Rules**: Ensures security schemes are defined
- **Response Validation**: Requires proper HTTP response codes
- **Built-in Protections**: Leverages Redocly's built-in security checks

This starter configuration is perfect for teams new to automated security validation.

{% /step %}

{% step id="api-example" heading="Example API Specification" when={"approach": "complete"} %}

This example OpenAPI specification demonstrates proper security implementation following validation best practices:

**Security Best Practices:**
- [HTTPS-only server URLs](api-tls-encryption-https-best-practices#enforcing-https-in-your-api-specification)
- UUID-based IDs to prevent enumeration
- [Comprehensive security schemes with JWT/OAuth2](authentication-authorization-openapi#authentication-methods)
- [Proper input validation with string length limits](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#key-security-constraints)
- [Rate limiting headers in all responses](api-rate-limiting-abuse-prevention#documenting-rate-limits-in-openapi)
- Complete error response definitions
- [`additionalProperties: false` to prevent mass assignment](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#attack-prevention-strategies)

Use this as a reference when implementing your own secure APIs.

## Security Validation Foundation

### Basic Security Configuration

Essential security rules for getting started with API validation:

- **Core Security Rules**: Ensures [security schemes are defined](authentication-authorization-openapi#authentication-methods)
- **Response Validation**: Requires proper HTTP response codes  
- **Built-in Protections**: Leverages built-in security checks

This starter configuration is perfect for teams new to automated security validation.

### Example API Specification

An example OpenAPI specification demonstrates proper security implementation following validation best practices:

**Security Best Practices:**
- [HTTPS-only server URLs](api-tls-encryption-https-best-practices#enforcing-https-in-your-api-specification)
- UUID-based IDs to prevent enumeration
- [Comprehensive security schemes with JWT/OAuth2](authentication-authorization-openapi#authentication-methods)
- [Proper input validation with string length limits](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#key-security-constraints)
- [Rate limiting headers in all responses](api-rate-limiting-abuse-prevention#documenting-rate-limits-in-openapi)
- Complete error response definitions
- [`additionalProperties: false` to prevent mass assignment](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#attack-prevention-strategies)

Use this as a reference when implementing your own secure APIs.

## Implementation Strategy

If you decide to use validation rules in your workflow, consider a gradual approach:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Example timeline: Weeks 1-2)**
- Start with basic built-in rules
- Try [HTTPS enforcement](api-tls-encryption-https-best-practices#enforcing-https-in-your-api-specification) and [basic authentication checks](authentication-authorization-openapi#authentication-methods)
- Consider integrating into CI/CD pipeline with warning-level severity

**Phase 2: Core Security (Example timeline: Weeks 3-4)**
- Explore [input validation](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#schema-based-validation-as-security-contract) and [resource consumption rules](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#key-security-constraints)
- Evaluate [mass assignment prevention](api-input-validation-injection-prevention#attack-prevention-strategies) patterns
- Consider escalating critical rules to error-level severity based on your team's needs

## Next Steps and Resources

### **Suggested Next Steps**
1. **Review the example configurations** in the code walkthrough above
2. **Consider starting small** if you're new to API security validation
3. **Test thoroughly in development** before using in production environments
4. **Adapt patterns** based on your specific security needs and organizational context

### **Integration with Security Articles**
This validation walkthrough complements our other security guides:

- **[TLS Encryption Best Practices](api-tls-encryption-https-best-practices)** - Learn about HTTPS enforcement approaches
- **[Input Validation Guide](api-input-validation-injection-prevention)** - Explore schema validation and input security patterns
- **[Rate Limiting Guide](api-rate-limiting-abuse-prevention)** - Understand rate limiting implementation options
- **[Authentication Guide](authentication-authorization-openapi)** - Review authentication and authorization security practices

**üîê Security Note**: This walkthrough demonstrates some validation approaches that can help identify common API security issues. Validation rules are just one layer in a comprehensive security strategy that should also include [proper TLS configuration](api-tls-encryption-https-best-practices), [robust input validation](api-input-validation-injection-prevention), [rate limiting](api-rate-limiting-abuse-prevention), and [strong access controls](authentication-authorization-openapi). Always review and test any rules thoroughly before using them in production, and customize based on your organization's specific security requirements and risk tolerance.
