# Automated API Security Validation - Interactive Walkthrough

*Transform your API security from manual reviews to automated enforcement using production-ready validation rules.*

---

## What You'll Learn

This interactive walkthrough guides you through implementing **automated security validation** that enforces the **OWASP API Security Top 10 2023** using Redocly's validation engine. By the end, you'll have a complete security ruleset that prevents vulnerabilities before they reach production.

**You'll master:**
- Setting up comprehensive security validation rules
- Automating OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 compliance
- Implementing custom security validation functions
- Integrating security checks into CI/CD pipelines
- Troubleshooting common validation issues

## Getting Started

{% step id="basic-rules" heading="Basic Security Rules" when={"config": "basic"} %}

Start with these essential security validation rules that provide the foundation for API security:

- **Security schemes required**: Ensures all operations have proper authentication
- **HTTPS enforcement**: Prevents insecure HTTP connections
- **Input validation**: Requires proper constraints on strings and arrays
- **Response validation**: Ensures proper error response definitions

This basic configuration is perfect for teams getting started with automated security validation.

{% /step %}

{% step id="api-spec" heading="Example API Specification" when={"config": "example"} %}

This example OpenAPI specification demonstrates security best practices:

**Key Security Features:**
- HTTPS-only server URLs prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- UUID-based IDs prevent object-level authorization vulnerabilities
- JWT authentication with proper bearer token handling
- Comprehensive input validation with length limits and patterns
- Rate limiting headers in all responses
- Complete error response definitions (400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 429, 500)
- `additionalProperties: false` prevents mass assignment attacks

Use this as a reference when building your own secure APIs.

## Implementation Strategy

Implementing automated security validation is an iterative process. Here's a recommended approach:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Implement basic built-in rules from the configuration above
- Test in development environment
- Set up CI/CD integration with warning-level severity

**Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 2)**
- Add custom security rules based on your API requirements
- Escalate critical rules to error-level severity
- Train team on validation rule interpretation

## Next Steps and Resources

### **Quick Start Actions**
1. **Download the basic configuration** using the walkthrough above
2. **Test with your OpenAPI specification** in development
3. **Integrate into CI/CD pipeline** to catch issues early
4. **Customize rules** based on your specific security requirements
