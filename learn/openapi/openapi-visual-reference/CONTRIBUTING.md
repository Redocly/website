The OpenAPI visual reference goal is to explain the visuals and corresponding types used for each part of the OpenAPI specification.

## Structure

- Use a flat file structure.
- All static images are in the `images` directory and compressed with TinyPNG.
- Host animated images on a 3rd party CDN if they are over 100 KB.
- The `sidebars.yaml` mostly mirrors the OAS structure.
- Object content has three sections: Excerpt from the spec, Visual examples, and Types.
- There is one summary page: `index.md`.
