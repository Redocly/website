# Admonition Tag [{% markdoc-tag-badge badgeType="Redocly" /%}](./tag-library#redocly-tag-badge)

The admonition tag calls your users' attention to a specific piece of information by placing it inside a pre-styled banner, separate from the main content.

{% admonition type="info" %}
Use admonitions to **add clarity** to your content or _communicate important information_.
{% /admonition %}

## Syntax and usage

Use the admonition tag to wrap content. Choose between the pre-built styles using `type`. Optionally add a header with `name`.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Important warning" %}
Stop! **Read me** before moving on.
{% /admonition %}
{% markdoc-example %}

```md {% process=false %}
{% admonition type="warning" name="Important warning" %}
  Stop! **Read me** before moving on.
{% /admonition %}
```

{% /markdoc-example %}

## Best practices

**Use in moderation**
Overuse of admonitions will reduce their effectiveness and users will learn to ignore them.

**Don't use for page content**
Carefully consider the information you put in your admonitions. They should add value and clarity or communicate something important. If readers don't know what to expect, then admonitions won't draw their attention effectively.

**Use clear headers**
Use short, impactful headers that reflect the content to set the tone and encourage users to pay attention to the message.

**Choose the right type**
Select the admonition type that aligns with the nature of the content. This helps users understand _intent_ and recognize the level of urgency. For example, you should use `warning` for cautionary information and `success` for confirmation or positive feedback.

**Admonitions _after_ content**
Avoid using admonitions as the first element below headers or section headers. Giving readers information to consider _before_ content adds to their cognitive load and reduces comprehension.
