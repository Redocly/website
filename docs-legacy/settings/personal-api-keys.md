# Personal API keys

Generate a personal API key to use some of our products:

- The [`@redocly/cli` `login` command](../../docs/cli/commands/login) (where you can subsequently use the [preview-docs](../../docs/cli/commands/preview-docs) or [push](../../docs/cli/commands/push) commands)
- Our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Redocly.openapi-vs-code)
- Access-protected API snapshots

You will also be able to reference your members-only API definitions.
