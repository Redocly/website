# Delete portal

{% partial file="/docs-legacy/_snippets/banner-legacy-developer-portal.md" /%}

You can remove the portal project from Workflows on the **Delete portal** page. Removing the project does not affect the source of the portal.

1. Navigate to the **Settings > Delete portal** page for the project you want to remove.

2. Select **Delete**. This opens the **Delete portal** dialog with a warning message.

3. In the dialog, enter the portal name and select **Delete portal** to confirm removing the project. Select **Cancel** to exit the dialog if you don't want to delete the project at this time.

4. After successfully removing the project, you are automatically redirected to the **Portals** page in Workflows.
