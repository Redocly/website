---

## 2.1.5 (2021-09-07)

### Features

- If you use custom names for `examples` to map request and response examples in your API definitions, such examples now automatically synchronize with each other when selected in Reference docs pages. How does that work? When you select a request example called `Simple payment` in the _Request samples_ panel, Reference docs looks for a response example with the matching name. If the `Simple payment` response example exists for that endpoint, it is automatically selected in the _Response samples_ panel.

---

## 2.1.4 (2021-09-01)

### Features

- Content type selection in Reference docs is now automatically synchronized between request and response schemas in the middle panel and the response and request examples in the right panel. When you select, for example, `application/json` in a request sample in the right panel, the content type for the request body schema in the middle panel automatically switches to `application/json` - no extra clicks needed!

When configured, these options affect all HTTP badges in the navigation sidebar and in the right panel:

- `fontFamily`
- `fontWeight`
- `color`

The following options affect specific badges based on their size (medium or small):

- `sizes.medium.fontSize`, `sizes.medium.lineHeight` - for badges in middle and right panels
- `sizes.small.fontSize`, `sizes.medium.lineHeight` - for badges in the navigation sidebar

### Fixes

- Two new theming options are supported in Reference docs, letting you control the width of buttons in the _Try it_ console. The options are called `components.tryItButton.fullWidth` and `components.tryItSendButton.fullWidth`. By default, both are set to `false` (disabled), which means the buttons are not set to their full width.

### Fixes

- Improved the approach to wrapping the request URL before the **Send** button in the _Try it_.

---

## 2.0.13 (2021-08-17)

### Fixes

## Reference docs 2.0 [2.0.3] (2021-07-08)

### Features

- This major release of Reference docs brings a complete visual overhaul to your API reference docs! Enjoy the new, clean and modern look with many usability and performance improvements under the hood.

Notice the following changes:

- Sticky language selection in code sample tabs persists between page reloads and across all operations on the page.
- Deep links let you quickly and easily access parameters and properties in response/request schemas.
- OpenAPI 3.1 is now supported, and Reference docs can build API documentation from your API definitions that use it.
- When using the search functionality, the results are now more readable and displayed in a centered floating window.
- The two buttons in the upper right corner let you control the layout of the page. Select **Hide samples** to remove the right panel with code samples and center the middle panel contents. Select **Change layout** to move the contents of the right panel into the middle panel.
- All request and response sections in middle and right panels are now expandable, and can be expanded/collapsed independently of one another.
- The **Try it** button is now smaller and fits right next to the operation in the right panel. The operation section can expand to show the list of servers.
- You can limit how many code sample tabs to show by default in the right panel with the `samplesTabsMaxCount` configuration option. The rest of the tabs are automatically folded into a "show more" menu.
- Models with `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf` are now displayed in tabs within the middle panel.

**For the full list of changes and upgrade instructions, make sure to read the [migration guide](./guides/migration-guide-2-0.md).**

{% admonition type="warning" name=" How to roll back to the old Reference docs design?" %}
Users who work with Reference docs on-premise should set the `@redocly/reference-docs` version to `1.5.14` to use the old Reference docs design.

For Reference docs hosted in Workflows, select `v1.x (legacy)` in the version dropdown on the **Settings > API reference settings** page of your Reference docs project.
{% /admonition %}

- You can now use custom hooks to inject additional components and modify or override the default Reference docs layout. The following new hooks are supported: `beforeOperation`, `afterOperation`, `beforeOperationSummary`, `afterOperationSummary`, `ReplaceTryItSecurityPanel`.

### Fixes

```yaml
type: oauth2
flows:
  implicit:
    x-defaultClientId: example123
    authorizationUrl: https://example.com/api/oauth/dialog
    scopes:
      write:pets: modify pets in your account
      read:pets: read your pets

---

## 1.5.12 (2021-06-21)

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue with custom favicon settings that were not applied (the favicon was not visible for the API reference documentation page). Additionally, you can now set a custom favicon when using the Reference docs CLI tool (for example, `reference-docs build openapi.yaml favicon=image.png`).

---

## 1.5.11 (2021-06-16)

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue with the _Try it_ console where an error was displayed in the _Auth_ tab after users corrected their previously incorrect credentials.

- Text in the **Payload** section for response and request samples now correctly applies typography theme settings and uses the font configured in `theme.typography.code.fontFamily`.

---

## 1.5.10 (2021-06-16)

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue that caused a crash when using the Reference docs library with Jest unit tests and a proxy-based mock.

---

## 1.5.9 (2021-06-15)

---

## 1.5.8 (2021-06-10)

### Fixes

- Resolved a compatibility issue with Webpack 5 so that it no longer requires a special loader when used with Redocly libraries.

---

## 1.5.7 (2021-06-01)

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue with incorrect width of the schema element in the middle panel.

---

## 1.5.6 (2021-06-01)

### Features

- When documenting `enum` values in your OpenAPI definition, you can now add an individual description for each of the values by using the `x-enumDescriptions` object. Reference docs displays the `enum` values and their descriptions as a table in the schema, in the same order as they are listed in the API definition. The table contents are partially hidden and can be expanded on click if there are more `enum` values than specified by the `maxDisplayedEnumValues` configuration option.

The following example shows how to add descriptions to `enum` values in your OpenAPI definition:

```yaml
user_status:
  type: string
  title: Status indicator
  description: 'Indicates the status of the user account. This status is visible only internally to account administrators.'
  x-enumDescriptions:
    ON: User account activated
    OFF: User account deactivated
    BAN: User account banned permanently
    CAT: User is a cat
```

---

## 1.5.5 (2021-05-24)

---

## 1.5.4 (2021-05-20)

### Features

- You can now replace the default "Username" and "Password" label text in the _Try it_ authorization section with any custom text. To do that, use the following options in your Reference docs configuration file(s):

```yaml
labels:
  tryItAuthBasicUsername: 'Your custom username label'
  tryItAuthBasicPassword: 'Your custom password label'
```

---

## 1.5.3 (2021-05-20)

---

## 1.5.0 (2021-05-06)

### Features

- A new configuration option `schemaExpansionLevel` lets you automatically expand schemas in your Reference docs. Set it to `all` to expand all schemas regardless of their level, or set it to a number to expand schemas up to the specified level. For example, `schemaExpansionLevel: 3` expands schemas up to three levels deep. The default value is `0`, meaning no schemas are expanded automatically.

- The `reference-docs` CLI tool now supports an option called `--html-template-variables`. Use it to pass custom dynamic values to your Reference docs HTML template at build time. For example, if your HTML template contains `{{{CUSTOM_VARIABLE}}}`, you can run `npx @redocly/reference-docs build openapi.yaml --html-template-variables '{"CUSTOM_VARIABLE": "Redocly"}'` to set its value to "Redocly". Note that the following variable names are reserved: `redocBody`, `redocHTML`, `title`, `redocHead`.

---

## 1.4.0 (2021-04-29)

### Features

- This major release of Reference docs marks an important point for users who rely on the Reference docs package. **The `@redocly/reference-docs-lib` package is now deprecated. For all use cases, you should use only the `@redocly/reference-docs` package (as the CLI tool and the React library)**.

---

## 1.3.19 (2021-03-16)

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue with `pagination: item` and `pagination: section` not working when an operation had the `#` symbol in its `operationId`.

- The Try It console now sends the correct payload format when using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

- Resolved an issue with path parameters not being replaced by user-provided values in the Try It console.

---

## 1.3.18 (2021-03-05)

### Features

- Simplified pagination settings are now supported in Reference docs. To configure pagination for your Reference docs, add the `pagination` key to the `referenceDocs` section of your `redocly.yaml` configuration file.

The `pagination` key can be set to any of the following values: `none` (all content is rendered on a single long page), `section` (each tag with a set of associated operations is rendered as a separate page), and `item` (each tag and operation items are rendered on separate pages). The default value is `none`.

### Deprecated

- The following configuration options for Reference docs have been deprecated, and their functionality superseded by the new `pagination` option. These options are still supported in `.redocly.yaml` configuration file(s), but the build logs show warnings if you continue using them. **We strongly recommend adjusting your configuration files to use the new pagination option.**

`layout.scope = all | section | item`

`layout.markdownItemsScope = all | section`

`layout.showTag = true | false`

`layout.showInfoOnEachPage = true | false`

`routingStrategy = browser | hash`

- The default pagination behavior has changed for the following items, and it's no longer configurable:

  - The tag description will not be displayed on each operation page (previously controlled by `layout.showTag = false`)

  - Contents of the `info` object will not be shown on each page (previously controlled by `layout.showInfoOnEachPage = false`)

  - Markdown items from the `info` object are not paginated, and are always displayed on a single page

---

## 1.3.17 (2021-03-04)
