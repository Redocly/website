To use **Redocly API reference docs** you need an OpenAPI definition (it's compatible with version 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 of the specification).

If you require Redocly API reference docs to be deployed on-premise only, such as due to specific security constraints, you are available to do that on our enterprise plan via two options:

- Using an HTML element (easiest)
- Building static documentation with a CLI tool (medium)

Find our [on-premise guide here](./guides/on-premise.md).
