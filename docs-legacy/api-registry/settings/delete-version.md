# Delete

Delete a version of your API.
Deleting a version from the registry will not affect the original version source.

{% admonition type="info" %}
You cannot delete a version if it has usages in any multi-version APIs or Portals. You must first remove it from any associated projects before you can delete it from the registry.
{% /admonition %}

1. Access the **Settings > Delete** page for the API version you want to remove.

2. Select **Delete**. A warning dialog displays.

3. Enter the version name to confirm, and select **Delete version**.

The **Delete** action permanently removes the API version and its API docs from the Redocly API registry.
