# People

Redocly allows customers to manage organization users (known as **People** in Redocly) with granular permission levels.

Using the **People** page, people with the `Owner` role can:

- [Invite new people](./invite-person.md) to access various projects in Workflows
- [Manage roles](./manage-roles.md#update-roles) to define permissions on these projects
- [Convert existing Redocly accounts to SSO accounts](./manage-roles.md#convert-redocly-accounts-to-sso-users)
- [Remove other people from the organization](./remove-person.md)

_A project refers to any API definitions/registries, API versions, Reference docs or Developer portal you create using the **Workflows** app._

{% admonition type="info" name="Attention" %}
Your plan/role may not allow you to invite or remove people to/from [Workflows](https://app.redocly.com). For more information, refer to the [Roles and permissions](./roles-permissions.md) topic.
