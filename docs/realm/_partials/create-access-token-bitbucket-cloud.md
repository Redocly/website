Before entering the connection details in Reunite, you need to create and copy a new repository access token for your account in Bitbucket Cloud.
Redocly uses this access token to establish a connection to your repository.
The access token you use needs to have `repository:write`, `pullrequest:write` and `webhook` scopes.

See the Bitbucket Cloud documentation for creating the following access token types with appropriate permissions and scopes:

- [Create a repository access token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-repository-access-token/)
- [Repository Access Token permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/repository-access-token-permissions/)
