Before entering the connection details in Reunite, you need to create and copy a new access token for your account in GitLab.
Redocly uses this access token to establish a connection to your repository.
GitLab offers multiple types of access tokens.
The access token you use needs to have `api` scope and at least `Maintainer` role.

See the GitLab documentation for creating the following access token types with the API scope option:

- [Create a personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token)
- [Create a project access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#create-a-project-access-token)
