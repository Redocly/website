Verified domains are a way for you to connect users with a given organization.
They only apply to corporate identity providers when logging into Reunite, not logging in to projects.
You can add a Verified domain on the **SSO and login** page in Reunite.

When you add a Verified domain to your organization, users logging in to Reunite with the verified domain email are automatically directed to the corporate identity provider, with the option to use Redocly credentials or social logins.
If you also select to require SSO authentication, users logging in to Reunite with the verified domain email domain can only log in using the corporate identity provider.
