Once you have your own copy of the project in a repository that you own, you can connect it to Reunite, Redocly's hosting platform, immediately.

To connect your repository in Reunite:

1. Log in to your Reunite account and [Create a new project](../../setup/how-to/manage-projects.md#create-a-project).
   The project is where you deploy your project from (note that only Redocly hosting is supported; these projects are not licensed to deploy from other platforms).

1. [Connect the Git provider](../../setup/how-to/git-providers/connect-git-provider.md) where your repository is hosted.

1. Wait for the project to build.

Alternatively, clone your copy of the template repository to your computer and run it locally for a quick preview, using the following steps:

1. Install [Redocly CLI](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/installation).
1. Run `redocly preview` in your terminal to see your project.
