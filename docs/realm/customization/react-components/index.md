# Customize theme components

You can customize theme components instead of ejecting them completely.

Customizing components can be useful in several scenarios:

- When developing custom components by reusing existing `theme` functionality, rather than building from scratch.
  This is particularly effective when integrating into more complex components.

- When extending or modifying the styles of existing components, especially in cases where the default theme `variables` are insufficient.

Find a list of available components with their properties in the [components list](./list/index.md) and a full list of supported icons in the [icons list](./list/icons.md).

For detailed instructions, see [Components usage tutorial](./use-in-react-page.md) or [Customize theme components](./wrap-components.md).
