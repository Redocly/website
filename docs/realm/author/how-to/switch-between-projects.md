# Switch between projects

Reunite enables you to work on multiple projects. Access to specific projects depends on the [role](../../setup/concepts/roles.md) you have in your organization and your [team membership](../../setup/concepts/teams.md).

You can switch between projects in a few different contexts:

* **Organizations and projects menu:**

  1. In the top-left corner of Reunite, click your organizations's icon.
  2. From the menu, click one of the project names.

* **Organization Overview page:**

  1. In your organization's **Overview** page find the tile with your project's name.
  2. Click the arrow button.

* **Navigation bar:**
  
  1. In a project's navigation bar, click the project name.
  2. From the menu, select one of the project names.
