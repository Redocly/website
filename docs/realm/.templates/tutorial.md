<!--Tutorial template
---------------------

The tutorial is learning based and not task-based.
Therefore, the tutorial is not purely instructions to complete a task, and includes everything needed to try to do the task including sample inputs.
Tutorials should be follow-along (you do).

Title
-----

The tutorial title should follow the following format: [Verb] a [noun] with [insert list of technologies here]
Only include one heading level 1 per page.
Use sentence case.

Example tutorial title: Fit an OpenSearch box to your Flask app or Build a temperature monitoring dashboard with InfluxDB and Grafana-->

# {Verb} a {noun} with {insert list of technologies here}

<!--Introductory paragraph
--------------------------

There are three topics you should cover in this section: learning objectives, intended audience, and any prerequisite background knowledge.
Explain what the user will be building in this tutorial. 
Include the problem we are solving and the components or tools that will be used to solve it.

For example: By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to build a custom theme using Reef.
This tutorial is intended for users with advanced React skills who have coded components.

Before you begin
----------------
This section describes what your users need to know, or need to have before they attempt the how-to.
If there are tools, accounts, licenses or particular dependencies that need to be installed before we start, let's get those out of the way first. 

Items can include:

- familiarity with the application
- software and tools needed
- environments to set up and configure
- authentication and authorization info
- other guides or information
- links to procedures or information

For example:

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following before you begin:

* latest version of New Hope
* finalized versions of your API definitions
* a redocly.yaml file in the root of your project-->

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following before you begin:

- [latest version of {% $env.PUBLIC_PORTAL_NAME %}](../get-started/index.md)
- []()

<!--Subheadings
---------------

Subheadings should start with a present-tense imperative verb.
Use sentence case.

Example subheading: Organize files-->

<!-- Steps
----------

Introduce the first piece of the puzzle. 
Tutorials need to be as logical as possible, which means making as few steps, or as few context changes as possible. 
For example, don't download a data file, create a database, install some code dependencies, import the data into the file, set some code up locally and then go back to the database for credentials. 
Instead, make the database, get and import the data, then set up the code with dependencies and connection information to build the app.

At each stage, if the user can DO something, that builds confidence and a sense of achievement. 
So if there's a "SHOW TABLES" command or something else to affirm that something is going well, have them do that, and explain how it fits the big picture, before you move on.
