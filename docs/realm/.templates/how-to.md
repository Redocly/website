<!-- How-to template
--------------------

The how-to guide takes your users through a series of sequential steps required to solve a specific problem or achieve a goal or accomplish a task.
Multiple tasks may be involved in achieving a goal.
The how-to assumes that a user has basic knowledge of the application and has already read the quickstart.
Do not use a how-to to teach concepts.

Title
-----

How-to guide titles start with a bare infinitive - no gerunds or -ing verbs.
You should only have one heading 1 on the page.
Use sentence case.

Example heading: Add a catalog -->

# Heading 1

<!-- Introductory paragraph
---------------------------

A clear description of the problem or task that the user can solve or complete.
When and why your user might want to perform the task.

For example: If you have many API definitions, a catalog is a more organized way to display your API definitions in your project.
Add a catalog to your project by completing the following steps:

1. Organize files: Organize your API definitions into one or more folders
2. Configure redocly.yaml: Add the catalog and navbar configurations to your redocly.yaml file
