<!-- Concept template
---------------------

Concepts explain background information and provide context-specific knowledge on a particular topic.
The goals of a concept is to help readers understand, not to teach concepts or provide steps in a task.

Concepts work well when they:

* Give context to a subject or topic that your readers might not have
* Explain the background about a topic that might not be evident in Reference or How To articles
* Suggest alternative approaches or different ways of thinking about a use case or technical problem.
* Help readers make connections between related concepts, and form a better understanding of the subject.

Concept titles can be nouns, though avoid gerunds if possible.
You are not explaining how to do something, but providing background into why or how.
