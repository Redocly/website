## Examples

Set up a site in French with Dutch and UK English options:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
l10n:
  defaultLocale: fr-FR
  locales:
    - code: nl-NL
      name: Dutch
    - code: en-GB
      name: English
    - code: fr-FR
      name: French 
```

With this setup, the directory structure should be as follows:

```treeview
your-awesome-project/
└── @l10n/
    ├── fr-FR/
    ├── nl-NL
    └── en-GB
```
