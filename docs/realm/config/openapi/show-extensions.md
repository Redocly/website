# `showExtensions`

The `showExtensions` option displays specification extensions ('x-' fields).
Extensions used by Redoc are ignored.
The value can be boolean or an array of strings with names of extensions to display.
When used as boolean and set to `true`, all specification extensions are shown.

Custom extensions are rendered only in the request details section and in individual field details; they do not appear elsewhere in the UI.
