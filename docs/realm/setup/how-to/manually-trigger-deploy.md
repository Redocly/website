# Manually trigger a production deploy

Deploys trigger automatically after committing content or merging a branch in Reunite, or your Git provider.
There may be situations, however, where you want to manually deploy your API website to the production environment.

The manual deploy feature uses the latest state of the project's default branch in the build process.

## Trigger deploy

1. In your project's left panel, click **Deploys**.
2. Make sure you have the **Production** toggle button selected.
3. In the top right corner of the window, click **Trigger deploy**.
   Reunite starts the deploy process and publishes your website to the project's URL.
