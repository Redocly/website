  ref:
    type: string
    description: 'The full git ref that is pushed. Example: `refs/heads/main` or
      `refs/tags/v3.14.1`.'
  before:
    type: string
    description: The SHA of the most recent commit on `ref` before the push.
  after:
    type: string
    description: The SHA of the most recent commit on `ref` after the push.
  created:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether this push created the `ref`.
  deleted:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether this push deleted the `ref`.
  forced:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether this push is a force push of the `ref`.
  base_ref:
    type:
      - string
      - 'null'
  compare:
    type: string
    description: URL that shows the changes in this `ref` update, from the `before`
      commit to the `after` commit. For a newly created `ref` that is
      directly based on the default branch, this is the comparison between
      the head of the default branch and the `after` commit. Otherwise,
      this shows all commits until the `after` commit.
  commits:
    type: array
    description: An array of commit objects describing the pushed commits. (Pushed
      commits are all commits that are included in the `compare` between
      the `before` commit and the `after` commit.) The array includes a
      maximum of 20 commits. If necessary, you can use the [Commits
      API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#commits) to
      fetch additional commits. This limit is applied to timeline events
      only and isn't applied to webhook deliveries.

    description: For pushes where `after` is or points to a commit object, an
      expanded representation of that commit. For pushes where `after`
      refers to an annotated tag object, an expanded representation of the
      commit pointed to by the annotated tag.
