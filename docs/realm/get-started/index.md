# Get started with Realm

Redocly projects are managed and deployed on Reunite, the Redocly cloud platform.
For development, you can use the built-in Reunite editor, or work locally using your favorite editor.

Start your first project either in your browser with Reunite, or using your local development tools:

- [Get started with the Reunite editor](start-reunite-editor.md): Use the built-in editor in Reunite.
- [Get started locally](start-local-dev.md): Use a code editor on your local device.
