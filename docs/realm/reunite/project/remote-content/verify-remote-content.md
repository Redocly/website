# Remote content automation

Reunite performs a standard set of verification processes each time changes are made to remote content in the project.

- Changes to remote content sources that support branching, trigger [verification of preview changes](#preview-changes-verification) for branches.
- Changes to the default project branch (usually `main`) or source, trigger [verification of production changes](#production-changes-verification).

Build logs, preview builds, and production builds are available on the **Deployments** page of your project's workspace.

## Preview changes verification

Reunite verifies preview changes when remote files change on remote source's non-default branches.

The process has the following stages:

1. A branch (for example `rem/git/rem_012345`) is created in the Redocly project's repository from the project's default branch.
2. Changes from the remote source are applied on to that branch (for example `rem/git/rem_012345`).
3. A preview build process runs for the `rem/git/rem_012345` branch to check for errors and to generate a preview of the site with the latest changes.

## Production changes verification

Reunite automatically verifies production changes when:

- the default branch (`main`) of the remote content source has changes
- a remote content source that does not support branching (such as an URL source) has changes.

The process has the following stages:

1. A branch (for example `rem/git/rem_012345`) is created in the Redocly project's repository.
2. Changes from the remote source are applied on top of the new branch (`rem/git/rem_012345`).
4. A branch build for `rem/git/rem_012345` branch is created to verify that changes do not break the project.
5. After successful build verification, Reunite automatically merges the branch into the production branch (if Auto-merge is enabled) and starts a production build.

## Automatically-created pull requests

A pull request with changes from remote content is created automatically when:
- changes are made to the default branch of the remote content source
- changes are made to a remote content source that does not support branching (such as URL source)

Additionally, one of the following conditions must be met:
- Reunite uses a Redocly-hosted repository
- Auto-merge is disabled

Otherwise, only the branch with changes from remote content is created and merged (if Auto-merge is enabled).

## Removal of autogenerated branches

Autogenerated branches are removed when:

- the remote branch is deleted
- the pull request is merged
