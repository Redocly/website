# Project runtime logs

Project runtime logs provide visibility into the execution of your project and its API functions.
You can use these logs to monitor activity, debug runtime issues, and ensure your project integrations are functioning as expected.

## Access runtime logs

To view the runtime logs for your project:

1. In Reunite, select your organization and project from the dashboard.
1. In the project sidebar, select **Runtime logs**.
1. Use the filters to narrow down logs by branch, build ID, time range, or log level (for example, Info, Warning, Error).

## Filter logs

You can filter logs using the following criteria:

- **Branch**: view logs for specific development or production branches.
- **Time range**: filter logs from the last 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day.
- **Search**: find specific keywords or request IDs within the log messages.

## CDN and runtime logs

Project runtime logs focus on events related to the execution of your project runner and API functions.
**Requests served directly from the Redocly CDN cache are not reflected in the Project runtime logs.**

Because cached requests do not trigger project runtime execution, they are omitted from this log stream.
This ensures the data remains focused on your application logic and runtime behavior.

## FAQ

### Why are some logs missing for my API functions?

If you have modified an API function in the Reunite editor but have not yet committed those changes, the logs for that function will not appear.
Runtime logs are generated by the deployed version of your project.
To see logs for updated API functions, ensure you have committed your changes to a branch, which triggers a new preview or production deployment.

### Why can't I see logs for every request to my project?

Runtime logs are intended for debugging your project code and API functions.
Requests handled by the Redocly CDN cache are not included because they don't reach the runtime environment.
If you need to verify that a request is being served, check the browser's network tab or your custom domain's analytics.

### Can I export my logs for external analysis?

Yes, you can export your logs in CSV or JSON format using the **Export** button on the Logs page.
This is useful for sharing debugging information with Redocly support or performing more complex analysis in third-party tools.

### What is the difference between build logs and runtime logs?

Build logs provide details about the process of generating your documentation site (e.g., linting, bundling, and deployment).
Runtime logs provide visibility into the activity of your live project after it has been deployed, specifically focusing on API function execution and server-side request handling.
