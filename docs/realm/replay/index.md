# Replay

Replay is a desktop app for running API requests and end‑to‑end workflows.

{% admonition type="info" name="Arazzo + OpenAPI" %}
Replay connects steps in a workflow to OpenAPI operations and lets you pass data between steps.
Use it to prototype integrations, validate flows, and generate reusable Arazzo collections.
