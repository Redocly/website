# Manage a collection

Collections are top‑level Arazzo YAML files that group related workflows and define `sourceDescriptions` (where operations come from).

## Create a collection

- Open the `Collections` tab.
- Click the `+` button.
- Enter a collection name and save.

## Rename or delete a collection

- Click the More actions button next to the collection.
- Choose `Rename` to change the name, or `Delete` to remove it.
- Confirm when prompted.

Deleting a collection removes its file from the project folder.

## Collection tab

When you click a collection in the tree, the collection tab opens in the main panel.
Use it to view and edit collection‑level information.

### Info

The Info section includes high‑level metadata that appears in your collection file.

- **Version**: Semantic version of the collection.
- **Title**: Title of the collection.
- **Summary**: Short one‑line summary.
- **Description**: Longer description that can span multiple lines.
