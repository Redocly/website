# Configure localization

You can make your project accessible to users who speak other languages by configuring localization.

To configure localization, complete the following tasks:

1. [Set up folder structure for localization](./set-up-l10n-folder.md)
1. [Add translated content](./localize-content.md)
1. [Localize the UI labels](./localize-labels.md)

Optionally you can:

* [Display the current locale on a page](./display-current-locale.md)
* [Customize styles for a locale](./customize-styles-for-locale.md)

## Resources

* View the options for configuring how languages are displayed in the language picker in the [l10n configuration reference documentation](../../config/l10n.md).
* Learn more about how localization works in a Redocly project in the [Localization](./concept-l10n.md) concept documentation.
