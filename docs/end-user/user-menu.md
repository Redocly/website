# User menu

If your project requires logging in to access its content, the user interface may include a user menu.
The user menu is located in the top-right corner of the project.

The menu contains the **Log out** command and, depending on the project, may also have links to project pages.

## Resources

- [Adjust the project](./adjust-project.md)
- [Navigate the project](./navigate-project.md)
- Explore other ways you can interact with the [user interface](./index.md)
