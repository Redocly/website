Some projects have AI-powered search enabled.
AI search saves the history of your conversations.

To use AI-powered search:

1. Open the Search dialog.
2. Click the **Search with AI** button.

## Filter search results

You can filter the results of your search to find the required information quicker.

### Use filter categories

Use search categories to restrict the results to the chosen category.
Projects come with two built-in search categories: **Documentation** and **API Reference**, but your project may have custom categories.
Categories are located under the search field.
After you enter a search query, each category button label displays the respective number of results.

To filter search results using categories, click a category button.
In some cases, you can select multiple categories at the same time.
Other categories allow only a single selection.

To reset category selection, click **All**.

### Use advanced search filters

Use advanced filters to narrow the search results and find relevant information faster.
This is especially useful when a project has a many or complex API description files.

To display advanced filters:

- Click the **Filters** icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

Projects typically have the following filter options:

- **Category**: display only the results that are included in selected categories.
  These categories are the same as in the [main Search dialog](#use-filter-categories).
- **HTTP Method**: display only the results with the selected HTTP methods.
- **HTTP Path**: display only the results with the selected paths.
- **API Title**: display only the results from the selected description files.
- **API Version**: display only the results from the selected description file version.

To clear all filters, in the top-right corner of **Advanced filters**, click **Reset filters**.
