# Interact with pages

Project pages have interactive elements you can use to provide feedback or copy code snippet content.

## Provide feedback for a page

A project can have different types of feedback forms:

- thumbs up or down icons
- mood icons, typically satisfied, neutral or unsatisfied
- a rating in the form of icons, typically from 1 to 5 stars
- a numerical scale, typically between 1 and 10
- a comment

After you interact with a form (except the comment form), a text field is displayed.
In this field, you can add more details to your feedback.

If you are logged in your project, your email address is automatically added to the feedback content.
The owners of the project can use the address to follow-up with you on your comment.
If are not logged in, or the project does not have login enabled, an optional **Email** field is displayed.

This function is especially useful with long code fragments.
