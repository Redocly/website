# Interact with pages

Project pages have interactive elements you can use to provide feedback or copy code snippet content.

## Provide feedback for a page

You can give your feedback for each
A project can have different types of feedback forms:

- thumbs up or down icons
- mood icons, typically satisfied, neutral or unsatisfied
- a rating in the form of icons, typically from 1 to 5 stars
- a numerical scale, typically between 1 and 10
- a comment

After you interact with a form (except the comment form), a text field is displayed.
In this field, you can add more details to your feedback.

If you are logged in a project, your email address is automatically added to the feedback content.
The owners of the project can use the address to follow-up with you on your comment.
If are not logged in, or the project does not have login enabled, an optional **Email** field is displayed.

After you click **Send**, your feedback is submitted.
