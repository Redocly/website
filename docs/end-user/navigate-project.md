# Navigate the project

The interface of a project has various elements you can use to navigate the project's contents.
Some of these elements might have been customized or disabled in your project.

## Skip to content

You can jump directly to the main content of a project's page, skipping navigation elements and auxiliary information.

To skip to the page's main content:

1. After navigating to a page, press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.
2. Press the <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, or click the **Skip to content** button.

The page content scrolls so that the first heading is at the top of the page.

## Use the table of contents

The table of contents (TOC) is displayed on the right side of the page and indicates your current position.
You can click any item on the TOC to jump to that heading.

## Navigate project pages

Projects have multiple elements you can use to navigate its content.
Depending on your device type (or screen size), the location and look of these elements can differ.

### Navigation bar

The navigation bar (navbar) contains links to major parts of the project.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab label="Desktop" %}
    On desktop devices, the navbar is located at the top of the screen.
    Some navbar items may contain a drop-down list of links.
    This list expands when you hover your mouse over a navbar item.
    Some projects may have [multiple products](#switch-between-products) that are displayed when you hover over the **Products** item.
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab label="Mobile" %}
    To access the navbar on mobile devices:
    - Select the **Menu** icon in the top-right corner of the screen and then select **Main menu**.

    The contents of the menu change to represent the structure in the navbar.

    Navbar items with nested links have a downward-facing arrow next to them.
    To expand the list, select the arrow.
    Projects with [multiple products](#switch-between-products) list them under the **Products** heading.
  {% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

### Sidebar

The sidebar represents the structure and the hierarchy of pages in a project.
A project can have a single sidebar with links to all pages, or a main sidebar with additional sidebars for different sections of the project's content.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab label="Desktop" %}
    On desktop devices, the sidebar is located on the left of the page.
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab label="Mobile" %}
    To access the sidebar on mobile devices:
    - In the top-right corner of the screen, select the **Menu** icon.

    The contents of the menu represent the structure of the sidebar.
  {% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a series of links that are displayed above the main content of a page.
The links are available only on pages that have at least one level of nesting in the sidebar.
The order of breadcrumb links typically reflects the hierarchy in the sidebar: from the top-level page of the project to the currently displayed page.

### Navigation buttons

You can also use the navigation buttons located below the main content of the page.
These buttons typically open the next page or the previous page in the order in the sidebar.
Some projects may have a custom order for the navigation buttons to guide users through related content.

## Switch between products

A project can have multiple products represented by distinct portions of content.
Products often have individual sidebars or other navigation elements, and their own visual style.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab label="Desktop" %}
    On desktop devices, if a project has multiple products, the navbar includes a **Products** item that has a downward-facing arrow next to it.

    To switch between products on desktop devices:

    1. In the navbar, hover your mouse over **Products**.
    2. Select an item from the drop-down list.

    The content of the selected product loads and the label of the **Products** navbar item changes to the name of the selected product.
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab label="Mobile" %}
    To switch between products on mobile devices:

    1. Select the **Menu** icon in the top-right corner of the screen and then select **Main menu**.
    2. Under the **Products** heading, select a link.

    The content of the selected product loads.
  {% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Switch between versions of a page

Pages that have multiple versions in a project display a version picker above the sidebar.
When you first access a page, the page's latest or default version is displayed.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab label="Desktop" %}
    To switch between page versions on desktop devices:

    - Above the sidebar, click the **Versions** dropdown and select a version from the drop-down list.
    
    The page's content changes to reflect the selected version.
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab label="Mobile" %}
    To switch between page versions on a mobile device:

    1. Select the **Menu** icon in the top-right corner of the screen.
    2. Under the **Version** heading, select a version from the drop-down list.
    
    The page's content changes to reflect the selected version.
  {% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}
