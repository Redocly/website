# Future RSS placeholder

This is a synthetic post dated slightly ahead of today so we can confirm that the blog RSS feed delivers the newest entries during manual and automated tests.

## Why you might see this

- Validates that feeds pick up the latest publish date.
- Keeps automated monitors from flagging stale content.
- Provides a safe rollout artifact without impacting users.

We'll remove or reuse it later once real announcements take over.
