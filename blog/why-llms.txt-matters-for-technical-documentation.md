# Why `llms.txt` matters for technical documentation

Your readers aren’t always human anymore.

AI agents are the go-to for developers trying to understand your API. They’re skimming your docs to answer developers’ questions, and sometimes hallucinating when they can't find what they need.

That’s where `llms.txt` comes in.

It's a simple file, but it represents a big shift in how documentation is accessed, indexed, and interpreted. If you care about discoverability, accuracy, and user experience (whether your user is human or not), it’s time to pay attention.

## Documentation discoverability issues for LLMs

Traditional technical documentation faces a fundamental challenge in the AI era. When developers ask an AI assistant about your API or product, the AI needs to quickly understand your documentation structure, find relevant content, and provide accurate answers. Without proper guidance, AI systems might miss critical information, misinterpret context, or fail to discover important documentation altogether.

This isn't just a theoretical problem. Developers increasingly rely on AI assistants for technical guidance, and the quality of AI responses directly correlates with how well the AI can access and understand your documentation.

## What is `llms.txt`?

`llms.txt` is a [proposed standard](https://llmstxt.org/) that's quickly gaining traction. It provides a structured, machine-readable index of your website and documentation for AI systems. `llms.txt` files contain contextual information that helps AI systems understand the relationship between different pieces of content and improve the quality of AI-generated answers

There are two useful ways to think about `llms.txt`.

One is as a curated guide for AI agents. While `robots.txt` tells search engines what to crawl or ignore, `llms.txt` is supposed to speak directly to large language models and their retrievers—guiding them to the right content.

The other is as a sitemap purpose-built for AI. Unlike traditional `sitemap.xml` files that focus on URL discovery for web crawlers, `llms.txt` adds context that helps LLMs understand how your docs are structured and how individual pages relate to one another.

## The `llms.txt` format: an example

The format is simple: a plain text Markdown index that lists your documentation pages along with brief descriptions. This simplicity is intentional: it ensures the file remains lightweight while providing maximum utility for AI systems.

Placed at the root of your domain (like `yourdomain.com/llms.txt`), it serves up metadata about your documentation, such as where it lives, how often it changes, how to respect your licensing terms, and which URLs to prioritize or avoid.

Here’s what a basic one might include:

# Title
> Optional description goes here
Optional details go here
## Section name
- [Link title](https://link_url): Optional link details
## Optional
- [Link title](https://link_url)

There’s no complicated markup or config hell. It’s just a plain-text way to make your docs more LLM-friendly. You can also check out our own `llms.txt` file [here](https://redocly.com/llms.txt).

## Why should you care?

You might be thinking: “We already wrote good docs. What does this file do that content quality doesn’t?”

The timing of `llms.txt` couldn't be better. As AI assistants become integrated into every developer's workflow, the quality of AI responses increasingly depends on how well these systems can access documentation. Companies investing in `llms.txt` today are positioning themselves for better AI discoverability tomorrow.

Consider the developer experience: AI assistants should be able to  provide accurate, contextual answers based on a clear understanding of your content hierarchy. Without `llms.txt` those AI agents will have a harder time making sense of your documentation structure and, ultimately, your product. It’s an unnecessary risk.

Here's what `llms.txt` actually unlocks.

### More accurate answers from AI tools

AI assistants don’t search the web like humans. They rely on retrievers, or agents, that look for documentation to add to their training or response context. If your API reference or guides aren’t clearly discoverable, the model might miss important context or generate outdated answers. llms.txt gives these retrievers a clear map.

### Control over what gets ingested
Not every page in your docs should feed an LLM. `llms.txt` lets you be selective. Maybe you want to exclude outdated guides, admin-only endpoints, or internal changelogs. You decide what makes the cut.

### Fewer hallucinations, fewer support tickets
AI hallucination isn’t just an academic problem; it shows up as user friction. Developers might ask Claude why your API returns a 403 and get a confidently wrong answer. Giving LLMs the right source material reduces noise and makes for a better dev experience.

### Alignment with your update cadence
Your documentation evolves, and your `llms.txt` file tells models when that happens. By updating the lastmod value, you’re signaling to retrievers that it’s worth re-checking your content. This means that there will be no more stale data hanging around in the AI ether.

## `llms.txt` is helping your docs team improve, too

Documentation teams implementing `llms.txt` often report several immediate benefits:
- Improved visibility into content structure: Creating `llms.txt` requires explicitly mapping relationships between docs, which often uncovers content gaps or redundancies.
- Encouragement for clearer organization: Writing succinct descriptions for each page helps teams evaluate whether content serves a clear and distinct purpose.
- More intentional documentation architecture: Maintaining the file encourages regular reviews, leading to smarter, more deliberate decisions about content structure.

## How often are LLMs actually checking for this?

Early data shows that `llms.txt` is being adopted by some forward-thinking companies and developers who are building custom AI retrieval systems. While major LLM providers haven't officially announced support yet, the standard is gaining traction as a community-driven approach to AI documentation discovery.

Isn’t this just SEO all over again?

Yes and no.

Like SEO, `llms.txt` is about making your content more accessible to machines. But unlike traditional SEO, which aims to rank pages in search results, this is about accuracy and comprehension. You’re not fighting for ranking; you’re fighting for relevance.

If your docs are already well-structured and clean, `llms.txt` just adds the missing piece: a handshake between your site and the LLMs crawling it.

## Getting started with `llms.txt` for your documentation

Setting up `llms.txt` isn’t complicated, but it does deserve a little forethought.

Your file should live at the root of your domain (`yourdocs.com/llms.txt`) and reflect how your docs are actually structured and not just how your CMS stores them. LLMs care more about conceptual organization than folder hierarchies.

The good news? You don’t have to do this by hand. Doc platforms have already started to auto-generate `llms.txt` based on your nav structure. That means less manual upkeep, and a file that stays in sync as your content evolves.

Bottom line: aim for a file that tells agents what’s important, how it connects, and what kind of content they’re looking at.

### From setup to more advanced configuration

A basic `llms.txt` file is already useful. But you can unlock even more value by giving AI systems extra clues.

- Add summaries to explain what each page covers
- Note whether a doc is a tutorial, reference, or conceptual guide
- Link related pages (i.e.,, “Auth → Rate Limiting → Errors”)
- Flag intended audience (beginner vs advanced, backend vs frontend)

For API docs, you might go deeper: show which endpoints power which workflows, or which docs are must-reads before getting started.

This context helps agents surface smarter answers, not just the right page.
