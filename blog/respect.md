APIs are the backbone of modern software,
yet too often, API issues go unnoticed until they cause real problems.
Unexpected status codes, incorrect content types, and schema mismatches can silently break integrations, degrade user experience, and even lead to security vulnerabilities.
That's why we built Respect Monitoring.

## What is Respect Monitoring?

Respect Monitoring is an OpenAPI-aware API monitoring solution that ensures your APIs behave exactly as expected.
Unlike traditional API monitoring tools that only check uptime,
Respect goes deeper by validating:

- ✅ Status codes – Ensures the API returns the expected status codes.
- ✅ Content types – Verifies that responses match the OpenAPI definition.
- ✅ Response schemas – Confirms that headers and body structures align with the OpenAPI spec, preventing data leaks.

This means no more silent failures—just APIs that work exactly as they should.

## Why we built Respect

At Redocly, we believe APIs deserve better.
Traditional monitoring tools tell you whether an API is up,
but they don't tell you whether it's behaving correctly.
Developers deserve a tool that doesn't just check for availability but validates correctness,
consistency,
and adherence to OpenAPI standards.
