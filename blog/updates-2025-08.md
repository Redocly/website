# August 2025 updates ☀️

August brought a wave of improvements across Redocly's product suite, with enhanced AI integration, better navigation, improved workflows, and a more robust feedback system.

Here's what's new:

## 🤖 Enhanced AI integration

We're expanding LLM capabilities throughout the platform:
- **GraphQL docs AI actions**: LLM-related page actions are now available in GraphQL documentation, bringing the same AI-powered assistance you love to your GraphQL schemas.
- **Smarter content filtering**: Fixed an issue where LLM page actions appeared on pages excluded from search — now they only show where they're meant to be useful.

## 🧭 Better navigation and UI

Navigation just got a major upgrade with improved breadcrumbs that make exploring large documentation sites effortless:
- **Refined visual design**: Cleaner, more intuitive breadcrumb styling.
- **Smart page name handling**: Long page names are automatically shortened to keep navigation clean.
- **Deep structure support**: Dropdown menus help you navigate complex documentation hierarchies.
- **Related page suggestions**: Discover relevant content as you browse.
- **Icon support**: Add visual cues to your breadcrumb navigation.
- **Multilingual translations**: Breadcrumbs work seamlessly across languages.
- **Cleaner catalog**: Fixed duplicate entries in the catalog for a tidier experience.

## ⚡ GraphQL enhancements

GraphQL documentation continues to get more powerful:
- **Enhanced security documentation**: The `@requiresScopes` directive now includes detailed security section documentation.

## 🔌 OpenAPI enhancements

- **Better discriminator handling**: Added search functionality to discriminator dropdowns for lists longer than six items — no more endless scrolling through options.

## 🔄 Workflow and AsyncAPI improvements

Developer workflows are getting smarter and more flexible:
- **Workflow execution**: You can now run workflows directly with full input schema support.
- **Enhanced Arazzo support**: Expression highlighting, completion support, and x-security integration make writing workflows smoother.
- **AsyncAPI metadata**: Support for the `x-metadata` extension gives you more control over your AsyncAPI documentation.
- **Updated UI elements**: New Play and WorkflowHierarchy icons, plus refreshed collection tree interface.

## 🛠️ Developer experience upgrades

Several quality-of-life improvements for developers:
- **Dynamic component loading**: New dynamic function in `@redocly/theme` enables lazy loading for better performance.
- **Authentication improvements**: 
  - `tokenUrl` values now serve as defaults in Try It security flows
  - Added support for accessing original identity provider tokens
- **Flexible configuration**: Made the `codeSamples->languages` parameter optional for easier setup.
- **Enhanced components**: Classic catalog card component is now part of the ejectable components library.
- **Better Markdoc**: Built-in functions and custom functions are now easily accessible in the Markdoc tags dropdown.

## 📝 Improved feedback system

Feedback management gets a significant boost:
- **Automatic spam detection**: New content-based spam detection keeps your feedback clean automatically.
- **Enhanced workflow**: Added "In Review" and "Resolved" statuses for better feedback lifecycle management.
- **Internal collaboration**: Team members can now add internal comments to feedback entries.
- **Git integration**: Pull request reviews are automatically posted to connected Git providers.

## 🎨 Enhanced Reunite experience

Reunite builds are now more informative and visually appealing:
- **Improved build logs**: Refined emoji usage, better alignment for multiline logs, and colorful status indicators for info and warning messages make tracking builds more intuitive.

## 🐛 Quality improvements

We've also shipped numerous fixes to make your experience smoother:
- **Better error handling**: Fixed crashes during sidebar generation with long folder names.
- **Improved authentication**: Updated environment variable naming (`OAUTH_USE_INTROSPECT` → `REDOCLY_OAUTH_USE_INTROSPECT`) and fixed various SSO-related issues.
- **Enhanced search**: Fixed RBAC-restricted content appearing in search results and improved search index generation.
- **URL handling**: Better support for trailing slashes and path prefixes across the platform.
- **Component fixes**: Resolved issues with code-walkthrough steps, mock servers, and various UI elements.
