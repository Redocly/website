# Dummy RSS connectivity test

This placeholder post exists purely to validate that RSS consumers can pick up new articles without any real product updates.

## Why this post exists

- Helps verify RSS caching behaviour.
- Provides a safe artifact for integration tests.
- Confirms that pagination and listing logic handle new slugs correctly.

## What to expect

Nothing will change for customers. This is a no-op article intended to make sure infrastructure can move data around as expected.
