January kicked off with momentum from 2024, and while we focused on refining existing features, we also shipped enhancements that improve search, navigation, and usability.
Bigger updates are coming in the next two quarters, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new right now.

---

## `img` Markdoc tag lightbox

We introduced the `img` Markdoc tag in December, and now we've added a **lightbox feature**! Users can click on an image to see a larger version with a lightbox effect. This was a highly requested feature, and we‚Äôre excited to roll it out.

{% markdoc-example renderDemo=true %}
  ```markdown {% title="Image example (click image to see lightbox effect)" %}
  {% img src="./images/january-feature-updates.png" withLightbox=true width="200px" /%}
  ```
{% /markdoc-example %}

## Enhanced search for API parameters

Searching API reference docs is now even more powerful.
You can now **search for specific operation parameters** and jump directly to the right place in your API reference.
No more endless scrolling‚Äîjust fast, precise access.

---

## Programmatically configure API request information

Save time by dynamically configuring [API request information](https://redocly.com/docs/realm/extend/how-to/configure-request-values).
This feature streamlines API request workflows for more efficient testing and integration.


---

## Optional email collection for feedback

Want to follow up on user feedback? You can now add an **optional email input field** to the feedback form, allowing users to share their contact details when submitting feedback.

---

## Improved organization invite functionality

We‚Äôve enhanced organization invites by:
- Adding expiration indicators.
- Tracking creation time for better management.
- Improving invite link sharing capabilities.
- Enhancing the UI with better visual feedback and a more intuitive action menu.

---
## Improved filtering on People page

A new **team filter** has been added to the People page, making it easier to find and manage users by team.

---

## Bitbucket Cloud repository support

Redocly now supports **Bitbucket Cloud** as a Git source. Connect your repositories seamlessly and sync API documentation from Bitbucket.

---

## Navigate to referenced definitions in OpenAPI files quickly

Working with `$ref` in OpenAPI just got easier.
Now, you can instantly navigate to referenced definitions, making it faster to edit and troubleshoot API specs.
