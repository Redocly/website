# Update on Redocly Workflows migration timeline

Over the past months, many customers have been actively migrating from Redocly Workflows to newer capabilities across the Redocly platform.
We appreciate the progress teams have made and the feedback shared throughout this transition.

Based on conversations with customers, we recognize that some organizations need additional time to complete their migrations successfully.
To support a smooth transition, we are extending the Workflows migration timeline.

At this time, we are not announcing a new retirement date.
Workflows will continue to be supported while customers complete their migration plans.

Our goal remains the same: Help every team transition in a predictable and low-risk way while continuing to improve the broader Redocly platform.

## What this means for customers

- Workflows will continue operating and remain supported during the migration period.
- Customers who need additional time may continue using Workflows while completing their transition.
- We encourage teams to share their migration timelines with us so we can provide guidance and support.

## Next steps

If you are currently using Workflows, please reach out to your Redocly contact or support team with your migration plan or any blockers you are facing.
Our team can help prioritize the right path forward.

We will provide advance notice before any future changes to availability.

Thank you for partnering with us as we evolve the platform and support your long-term success.
