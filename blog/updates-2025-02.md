# February 2025 updates 🚀

February was a **big month at Redocly** as we launched **two new products**: [**Respect**](/pages/respect-cli/respect-cli.page.tsx) and [**Respect Monitoring**](/pages/respect/respect.page.tsx).

We also made **AI-powered search** and **Typesense search** available, enhancing documentation navigation with **faster, smarter** search capabilities.
Another **major milestone**—**theme component ejection** from **Reunite** is now **generally available**, offering even greater customization.

Beyond these key launches, we’ve **continued our commitment to stability**, fixing bugs and optimizing platform performance.

Here’s what’s new:

---

## **🔍 AI Search**

AI search is now generally available for **Enterprise** and **Enterprise Plus** plans. This feature **enhances documentation search capabilities** by:

✅ Understanding **natural language queries**\
✅ Delivering **more relevant results** in less time\
✅ **Reducing friction** in API discovery

AI search is designed to **help developers and technical teams** find the right answers **faster**, cutting down on time spent searching through documentation.

**Want to customize AI search settings?**
You can [add your own custom prompt](/docs/realm/config/search).

Don't want it?
You can also **turn AI search off** in your `redocly.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
search:
  ai:
    hide: true
```
---

## ⚡ Typesense Search

We’ve also introduced **Typesense search**—an alternative search engine that provides:

✅ Ultra-fast API documentation search\
✅ Advanced filtering and facets\
✅ Improved relevancy ranking

This feature is available for Enterprise and Enterprise Plus plans.

To enable it, add the following to your `redocly.yaml` file:

```yaml
search:
  engine: typesense
```

Typesense **enhances search performance** while giving teams more **control over indexing and results**.

## 🎨 Eject Components from Within Reunite

Reunite now allows users to eject theme components, enabling even deeper customization of your documentation.

{% img src="./images/2024-11-eject-preview.png" alt="Eject preview" height="100px" withLightbox=true /%}

With component ejection, you can:
- Modify UI elements without affecting core functionality
- Customize styling, layouts, and interactions
- Maintain flexibility while leveraging Redocly’s framework

This gives teams the best of both worlds:

🔹 The power of pre-built themes with the flexibility of custom development.
