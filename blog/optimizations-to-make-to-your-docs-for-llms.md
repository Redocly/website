# How to optimize your docs for LLMs

Let's be honest: developers aren't reading your documentation the way they used to. They're asking AI agents instead of digging through your carefully crafted API reference. And if your docs aren't optimized for these AI tools, your developers are getting incomplete or wrong answers about your APIs.

You've probably already realized this isn't some distant future problem; it's happening right now. Your support team might be already seeing tickets that could have been avoided if AI tools could properly understand your documentation. Your developer onboarding could be taking longer because AI assistants can't parse your getting started guides effectively.

The good news? Fixing this isn't as complicated as you might think. It just requires rethinking how you structure and format your documentation with AI consumption in mind.

## Common challenges with API docs and LLMs

AI models don’t read documentation like humans do. They can't look at your beautiful layout, understand visual hierarchy, or fill in context gaps the way a developer can. Instead, they process text in a very specific way that documentarians may not have considered in the past. 

### Poor formatting confuses tokenization

AI models break down text into small pieces called tokens. When your documentation has poorly formatted code examples or inconsistent parameter names, these tokens get fragmented in ways that lose meaning.

Take this common pattern in API docs:

```
Set the api_key parameter to your-key-here when making requests.
```

Without proper formatting, the AI might split `api_key` into separate pieces, making it harder to understand what you're actually talking about. Your developers ask the AI about authentication, and it gives them a confused answer because it couldn't properly identify the parameter name.

### Mixed topics confuse AI chunking

AI systems organize information into chunks, usually paragraph-sized sections. When you mix different topics in the same section (like putting rate limiting info in your authentication section), the AI can't separate the concepts. So when someone asks about authentication, they get rate limiting details mixed in, making the answer less useful.

Some tool can help - Redocly, for example, automates the creation of your `llms.txt` file with a lightweight Markdown index that may help AI assistants navigate your docs more intelligently.

### Similar sections lead to retrieval errors

AI tools use vector embeddings to find relevant information. If your documentation has similar-sounding sections that cover different topics, the AI might return the wrong section entirely. This is especially common with API docs that have multiple types of authentication or similar endpoint names.

## How to write LLM-friendly documentation

After testing dozens of documentation approaches with various AI tools, here's what consistently produces better results:

### 1. Keep your heading structure predictable

AI systems use your headings like a roadmap. When you skip levels or use inconsistent patterns, they get lost.

**This confuses AI:**

```
# API Reference
### Rate Limits
#### Authentication
## Error Codes
```

**This works better:**

```
# API Reference
## Authentication
### API Key Setup
### Token Management
## Rate Limits
### Request Limits
### Error Handling
## Error Codes
```

The predictable structure helps AI understand how concepts relate to each other. When developers ask about authentication, the AI knows exactly where to look and what context to include.

If you're using modern API documentation platforms (like Redocly), this structure gets generated automatically from your OpenAPI specs. This automation frees up your team to focus on higher-value quality control tasks like ensuring clarity, accuracy, and overall developer experience.

### 2. Stick to one term for each concept

This might feel repetitive, but AI systems get confused when you use different words for the same thing. Pick one term and use it consistently throughout your docs. Modern documentation platforms (like Redocly) offer linting capabilities that can automatically detect and flag terminology inconsistencies, making this easier to maintain at scale.

**Confusing for AI:**

```
Configure the API key, then use your access token to authenticate requests, and include the auth credential in the header.
```

**Clear for AI:**

```
Configure the API key, then use your API key to authenticate requests, and include the API key in the header.
```

Yes, it reads a bit awkwardly to humans, but AI systems will give much more accurate answers when you're consistent with terminology.

### 3. Format code examples properly

This is probably the biggest quick win. Inline code without proper formatting gets tokenized unpredictably, leading to broken examples in AI responses.

**Bad for AI:**

```
Install the SDK with npm install @company/api-client@2.1.0 and then import it.
```

**Good for AI:**

```
Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @company/api-client@2.1.0
```

Then import it in your code:

```
import { ApiClient } from '@company/api-client';
```

Properly formatted code blocks ensure AI systems can provide accurate code examples when developers ask for them. 

### 4. Provide text alternatives for visual content
The AI being used on your docs probably can't see your diagrams, screenshots, or videos. If those elements contain important information, you need to describe them in text.

**AI can’t use this:**

```
![API Flow Diagram](auth-flow.png)
The diagram shows the complete authentication process.
```

**AI can use this:**

```
![API Flow Diagram](auth-flow.png)
**Authentication Flow:**
1. Client sends credentials to `/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in Authorization header for subsequent requests
4. Server validates token and processes request
The diagram above illustrates these four steps with arrows showing the request/response flow between client and server.
```

### 5. Be explicit about what you're referring to

Pronouns and vague references create ambiguity that AI systems struggle with. Being explicit reduces confusion.

**Ambiguous:**

```
Update the configuration file and restart the server. If it fails, check the logs.
```

**Explicit:**

```
Update the `config.yaml` file and restart the application server. If the application server fails to start, check the application server logs.
```

## Testing your documentation with LLMs and AI tools

The best way to know if your optimization efforts are working is to test them the same way your developers do: by asking AI tools directly.

Pick a few critical workflows (authentication, key endpoints, error handling) and test them with ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever AI tools your team uses. Ask questions like:

- "How do I authenticate with the Company API?"
- "Show me a curl example for the users endpoint"
- "What does a 403 error mean in this API?"

If the AI gives you accurate, complete answers, your structure is working. If it's confused, missing steps, or mixing up concepts, you've found areas that need improvement.

## The practical path forward

Here's how to actually implement this without disrupting your entire documentation workflow:

- **Start with your highest-impact content.** Don't try to optimize everything at once. Focus on your authentication docs, key endpoints, and getting started guide. In other words, the stuff your developers hit most often.
- **Use your OpenAPI spec as the foundation.** If you're maintaining API documentation manually, you're making this harder than it needs to be. [Tools like Redocly can generate consistently structured documentation](https://redocly.com/) from your OpenAPI specification, automatically handling most of the formatting issues that confuse AI systems.
- **Test incrementally.** As you make changes, test them with AI tools. This gives you immediate feedback on whether your optimizations are actually improving the experience.
- **Track the impact.** Monitor your support tickets and developer onboarding metrics. As your documentation becomes more AI-friendly, you should see fewer basic questions and faster time-to-first-success for new developers.

## Why specification drives LLM-optimized documentation

Here's what we've learned from working with enterprise teams: the most successful approach to AI-optimized documentation is generated from structured specifications rather than manually written directions.

Your developers are already using AI to understand your APIs. Optimizing for AI doesn't mean sacrificing the human experience, it means creating documentation that works well for both. Clean structure, consistent terminology, and proper formatting benefit everyone who interacts with your docs.

When your documentation comes from OpenAPI specs, you get a solid foundation for AI-friendly formatting. Code examples are consistently formatted, terminology stays consistent across endpoints, and the structure remains predictable. 

## The automation-human partnership

The most effective documentation teams don't choose between automation and human oversight, they use automation to enhance human expertise. Redocly's approach automates repetitive tasks like structural validation, and formatting consistency, freeing your team to focus on what humans do best: ensuring clarity, accuracy, and developer experience.
