## Features to change your API life

ðŸ“– [Generate brilliant docs](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/api-docs/), a key ingredient to every successful API project. Use `redocly preview-docs` to work on your API and documentation locally, then use `redocly build-docs` to produce HTML (rendered by [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc)) to publish.

ðŸŽ¯ Get your API right every time with [API standards](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/api-standards/) and `redocly lint`. Consistent API standards, compliance and governance make for delightful developer experiences.

ðŸ§© Break long OpenAPI files into smaller pieces with `redocly split`, so you can focus on what matters. Afterwards, the `redocly bundle` command quickly recombines the pieces into a single file for output.

ðŸ“Š Glance at the shape and size of an API with `redocly stats`.

ðŸ”€ Combine separate APIs into a single OpenAPI description with `redocly join`.

## Your API tooling, your way

If JavaScript is your thing, then use NodeJS and install [Redocly CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redocly/cli) using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), or run it with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). If not, then you can [use Redocly CLI from Docker](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/installation/#a-iddockerarun-commands-inside-docker) instead.

With a common configuration file, `redocly.yaml`, for all Redocly tools, using our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Redocly.openapi-vs-code) or [hosted documentation platform](https://redocly.com/reference/) is an easy move at any time. Or use the Redocly CLI as it is, in the context of your GitHub Actions, existing scripts, or other platforms.
