## Technical Writer hiring update

Redocly has now successfully completed hiring their technical writers for the Google Season of Docs 2021.

- [Heather Cloward](https://twitter.com/HeatherCloward1) will be joining us on our Redoc project, helping create product documentation and updating the README for the project.
- [Anton Zolotukhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bandantonio/) brings his immense experience working on open source projects and previous participant on Google Season of Docs 2019 and 2020, to our OpenAPI CLI project.

We received a large number of quality applications and it is heartening to see so many individuals eager to contribute to open source projects.

### Season of Docs 2021 organizations

Redocly's open-source project application has been accepted in the [Google Season of Docs 2021](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants) program.

## About Redocly

Redocly was founded in 2017 with the mission to get more consumers using APIs with less hands-on support. We were born out of Redoc, the popular open-source OpenAPI documentation software project used by thousands of companies worldwide. We make API design and documentation software with the goal to improve the developer experience. Our suite of products makes our customers’ APIs more accessible and resultantly, more loved by their end users and consumers.

## Our open-source tools

Our open-source tools allow developer teams to create clean, accessible documentation to complement their APIs. By making sure that the project documentation is complete, accurate and up-to-date, community contributors can add immense value to their open-source projects.

**Redocly CLI**

Source: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli)

Documentation: [Redocly website](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/)

An open-source CLI tool that helps users with quality control and publishing of their OpenAPI definitions. It can validate OpenAPI definitions according to built-in and custom, user-created validation rules; split a single OpenAPI definition into multiple files, or do the opposite (bundle a multi-file definition into a single file). It can also build a preview of reference docs - either with our open-source product Redoc or with its full-featured premium version.

**Redoc**

Source: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)

An open-source API documentation generator that takes an OpenAPI definition and creates three-pane-style HTML documentation from it. The look and feel of the generated documentation can be customized with configuration options and specification extensions supported by Redoc. The documentation can be generated as a single, fully portable, zero-dependency HTML file. One of the main advantages of Redoc is its extensive support for OpenAPI 3.0 specification features, and the ability to render specification components that many other similar tools do not support.

## About our project

**Redoc** currently does not have comprehensive documentation. All project information exists in the README file on the GitHub repository and a few other topics within the docs folder in the repository. The current README.md on the [Redoc GitHub repository](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) is outdated and needs to be updated with relevant examples, screenshots and other information.

The [OpenAPI CLI documentation](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/) is currently publicly available for users. There are sections in the docs that need to be updated or refreshed with relevant information. Users currently find it difficult to find information quickly, and some of the new features are not completely documented.

## Our project’s scope

The technical writers working as part of this project will:

- Create documentation for Redoc and provide more examples of options, vendor extensions and updated screenshots. This content will be published on Redocly's publicly accessible [technical documentation site](https://redocly.com/docs/).
- Update README for Redoc with relevant examples, screenshots and other information.
- Update current documentation on OpenAPI CLI, available on Redocly's [technical documentation site](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/).
- Organize and consolidate information and suggest ways to make the documentation more streamlined and responsive to customer feedback.
- Incorporate feedback from documentation testers (volunteers in the project) and the wider community.
- Work with the Redocly team to test existing documentation end-to-end, and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Measuring  our project’s success

Our contributors currently use GitHub issues, Write the Docs Slack channel, StackOverflow and other social channels to raise issues and fixes with the documentation.

We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the new documentation:

- There is a decrease in the number of issues and StackOverflow questions by 20%
- There is an increase in the number of contributions for creating or updating documentation

## Project budget

Budget item  | Amount | Running total |  Comments
--|---|---|--
Technical writer/s to update, test, and publish new documentation | $10,500  | $10,500 |
Volunteer stipends | $500  | $11,500  | 2 community volunteers x $500 each
Project swag  | $200  | $11,700  |  Design and print swag (t-shirts and stickers)
Design docs assets  | $550 | $12,250  |  Create project docs branding, logos, and templates
Total  |   | $12,250  |

## Additional information

**Previous experience with technical writers or documentation**

Redocly currently has two technical writers working on documentation for their premium products. The technical writers are responsible for scoping, planning and working with the development team to create documentation for new features and support material across Redocly's products.

We create content in Markdown, and use the GitHub flow to review content via PRs before publishing this content to Redocly's technical documentation site. We have a well-documented process of identifying, prioritizing and creating content that will be beneficial to technical writers working with us in the Season of Docs.

**Previous participation in Season of Docs, Google Summer of Code or others**

While Redocly as an organization has not participated in Google Season of Docs or Summer of Code before, one of our technical writers has been a participant in the Google Season of Docs 2019 and successfully worked with an open-source project to create documentation for their project. Our other technical writer is actively involved in the KDE community both as a mentor and a contributor.
