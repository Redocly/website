The free trial lasts for 30 days from the date you create your organization. During this time, you have full access to all features and capabilities.

### Can I change plans after subscribing?

Yes, you can upgrade or change your plan at any time from the Billing page. Changes take effect immediately, and billing is prorated accordingly.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards. For Enterprise+ plans, we also offer invoice payments (check or wire transfer). See our [W-9 form](/billing/w-9) for invoice payment details.

### Can multiple people manage billing?

Yes, you can invite team members to your organization and assign them billing permissions. This allows others to manage subscriptions and billing on your behalf.

### What's the difference between monthly and annual billing?

Annual billing offers cost savings compared to monthly billing. Both plans include the same features—the only difference is the billing frequency and total cost.

### Do you offer discounts for annual plans?

Yes, annual plans are priced at a discount compared to monthly plans. Check our [pricing page](/pricing) for current rates and savings.

### I'm having trouble signing up. What should I do?

If you encounter any issues during signup, please [contact our support team](/contact-us) and we'll help you get started.

### I'm migrating from Workflows. What do I need to know?

Redocly Workflows is being sunset on February 28, 2026. If you're currently using Workflows, you'll need to migrate to Reunite (which includes Realm, Redoc, Revel, and Reef). Here's the migration process:

1. **[Sign up](https://auth.cloud.redocly.com/registration)** using the same email address you used in Workflows. This will help ensure a smooth transition.
2. **Create your organization** - This will automatically start your free 30-day trial.
3. **Complete the migration** - Follow our [technical migration guides](/docs/realm/get-started/migrate-api-reference) to migrate your content and configuration from Workflows to Reunite.
4. **Subscribe and set up billing** - Billing for Reunite is separate from Workflows, so you'll need to set up a new subscription.
5. **Cancel your Workflows subscription** - Once your migration is complete and verified, you can cancel your Workflows subscription.

{% admonition type="info" %}
Your Workflows subscription and Reunite subscription are separate. You can run both in parallel during your migration period to ensure a smooth transition.

### What's a seat/user?

A user is someone with a Redocly account, whether they log in through the Redocly login provider or your own identity provider with single-sign-on (SSO).

Seats count for users who have the OWNER, MEMBER, or COMMITTER roles. Additional roles such as BILLING and VIEWER are users that do not count towards your seat limits.

### Do you charge for readers?

We do not charge for readers. We call those roles viewers.

### Why do you charge for contributors?

We've gone to great lengths to make it easier to contribute. This includes meeting developers where they are, in their IDEs and Git tools.

At the same time, others can join in a web-based experience with a Webview and visual review tool. We've put a lot of time and effort into the project, and charge based on actual contributions.

### What happens if we hit a usage limit?

Budgets are set for metered items and usage limits are part of your paid-in-advance order configurations. This prevents any surprises on your billing statements.

- **Seats**: Once the project seats purchased is reached, you cannot invite another user. In the case that you use SSO with JIT sign up, the user cannot login successfully until additional seats are purchased. Seats are billed in advance.
- **Projects**: Your plan includes a certain number of projects. Once you reach that limit, you cannot create any additional projects unless you purchase additional projects. Projects are purchased in advance.
- **Pages**: Each route in your project website counts as a page. When you reach your page limit as set by your budget, no additional deployments are possible until you reduce your limit to at or below the allowed number of pages (or increase your budget).

### Can I set a budget for metered items?

There is one metered item: pages.

Your plan includes fair usage and 80% of customers should incur no additional costs. Additional metered usage can be restricted by setting a monthly budget in the billing center.

### Why do you charge for extra pages?

Pages in a project affect the resources we allocate to host your project. Unlike Redocly of the past, we run your project as a server which allows for amazingly rich user experiences and a lot of extensibility not available in a static site. This in turn consumes extra memory and CPU to run and grows as the number of pages grow. Fortunately, we also found that as the number of pages grow the value to you and your customers also grows. Paying for extra pages is not a penalty. We rather think of it as a win-win.

### How do I estimate the cost?

To make estimations for your project please visit the [pricing calculator page](/calculator).
