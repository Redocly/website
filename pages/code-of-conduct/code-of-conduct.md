# Code of conduct

## 1. Purpose
The primary goal of Redocly’s **Code of conduct** is to foster inclusive, collaborative and safe working conditions for all Redocly staff and community members. As such, Redocly is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all staff, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This **Code of conduct** outlines our expectations for all Redocly staff and community members, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Scope

The **Code of conduct** applies to all Redocly staff. This includes full-time, part-time and contractor staff employed at every seniority level. The **Code of conduct** is to be upheld during all professional functions and events, including but not limited to business hours at the Redocly office, during Redocly-related extracurricular activities and events, while attending conferences and other professional events on behalf of Redocly, and while working remotely and communicating on Redocly resources with other staff.

We expect all Redocly staff to abide by this **Code of conduct** in all business matters -- online and in-person -- as well as in all one-on-one communications with customers and staff pertaining to Redocly business.

This **Code of conduct** also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of business activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of Redocly staff and clients.

## 3. Culture & citizenship
A supplemental goal of this **Code of conduct** is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize the relationships between our actions and their effects within Redocly culture.

**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a company that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

**Be considerate.** Your work at Redocly will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a company where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is neither productive nor pleasant. Redocly staff should always be respectful when dealing with other personnel as well as with people outside of Redocly employment.

## 4. Acceptable and expected behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all Redocly staff and community members:
- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of Redocly.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions at all times.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert Redocly leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this **Code of conduct**, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that Redocly events may be shared with members of the public and Redocly customers; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations at all times.

## 5. Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them in any manner.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 6. Consequences of unacceptable behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any Redocly staff, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If a staff member engages in unacceptable behavior, Redocly leadership may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including suspension or termination.

## 7. Reporting violations

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an appropriate member of Redocly leadership as soon as possible.

It is a violation of this policy to retaliate against any person making a complaint of Unacceptable Behavior or against any person participating in the investigation of (including testifying as a witness to) any such allegation. Any retaliation or intimidation may be subject to punitive action up to and including termination.

## 8. Disciplinary action

Colleagues who violate this policy may face disciplinary consequences in proportion to their violation. Redocly management will determine how serious an offense is and take the appropriate action.

## 9. Responsibility

It is your responsibility to ensure this policy is followed.
