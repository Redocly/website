# Feature requests and roadmap

We welcome feature requests from all customers and value transparency about our roadmap. Here's what you can expect.

## Submitting feature requests

- Email team@redocly.com.
- Subject line has "[feature request]"
- Include:
  - A clear description of the feature
  - The problem it solves
  - Any workarounds you use today
- We may reach out to clarify details before logging the request.

## How we evaluate requests

- We log all requests in our internal tracking system.
- Evaluation criteria:
  - Impact and urgency of the problem
  - Availability of workarounds or alternative solutions
  - Alignment with our product vision and long-term strategy
- Prioritization works the same for all customers.

{% admonition type="info" name="Premium support customers" %}
Premium plans don’t guarantee a "fast track."  
However, ongoing touchpoints with your Redocly advisor help:
- Identify problems earlier
- Provide richer context to strengthen a feature request
- Inform roadmap discussions more effectively

## Our roadmap

- We don’t maintain a public, detailed roadmap.
- Instead, we publish blog posts highlighting:
  - Recently released features
  - Roadmap items we're actively developing
- Here's a [sample roadmap sneak peek update](https://redocly.com/blog/updates-2025-05#-roadmap-sneak-peek).

_We believe roadmap discussions work best when tied to real problems and customer outcomes. By sharing your context and challenges, you help us shape the most valuable improvements to Redocly._
