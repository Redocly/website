Examples of insecure services, protocols, or ports include but are not limited to FTP, Telnet, POP3, IMAP, and SNMP.
- Create a firewall configuration that restricts connections between approved networks and all the components of the system in the environment of personal data. Need to examine the rules of firewalls and routers at least every six months. A rule "blocks all" must still apply in the end. Firewalls must be used at least at every endpoint connecting to the Internet, including mobile and employee-owned devices.
- Prohibit direct public access between Internet and any component of the system in the environment of personal data.
Disable all services and protocols not required (services and protocols not directly needed to perform the specified function of the device).
- Encrypt all administrative access with the use of technologies such as SSH, VPN, or SSL/TLS for Web-based management and other administrative access.
- Validation of secure communications.
- Restrict physical access to publicly accessible network jacks.
- Restrict physical access to the gateways, mobile handheld devices and wireless access points.
- Use intrusion detection systems and/or intrusion prevention systems to monitor all traffic in the data environment and report to staff all suspicions relating to potential alterations. Keep all detection and intrusion prevention engines updated.
- When you access personal data through remote access technologies, prohibit copying, moving and storing of personal data on local hard drives and removable electronic media.
- Network architecture and its segmentation approach must be setup to permit: isolation, control, supervision and optimization of information flow and control. Those zones must consider internal and external users, privilege levels, business partners, service providers, customers and the general public.
- The firewall and antivirus logs should be reviewed daily.
- All firewall rules must be reviewed at least every six months.
- When necessary, ACLs can be implemented in routers, but firewalls must be given priority at all times (for ACL).
- Account passwords should be configured using the 'Secret' command replacing the "Password" command (if equipment allows).
- When configuring a service that doesn’t offer encrypted and strong authentication, the use of a "high port" is mandatory.
- Mandatory strong (double) authentication for establishing remote connection over the network.
- Secure communications must be validated / tested before being put into production.
