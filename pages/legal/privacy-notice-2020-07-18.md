<h4 id="section4-5">4.5 How do we keep your personal information secure?</h4>
<p>We are committed to security and privacy, maintaining appropriate physical, technical and administrative standards to protect the personal information that we collect.

This means that we have taken extensive security measures that include: physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards; documented security policies; use of strong encryption for data transmission; security monitoring tools; and restricted access to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We require all service providers to take appropriate steps to safeguard the security and privacy of your personal information. The service provider must fit into our overall security framework as part of our compliance.</p>
<p>However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="section4-6">4.6 How long do we keep your personal information?</h4>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
