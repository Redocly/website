# Pandemic plan

It's our goal continuously provide service and support to our customers.
We will continue to provide service as usual in this otherwise unusual time.

We have the following policies in place which support our business continuity plan.

- We're all allowed to work from home (and must work from home if we feel unwell or were exposed to anyone who has the virus).
- We've stopped all business travel (and encouraged stop of all personal travel).
- We've encouraged everyone to take all precautions to stop the spread of the virus, and follow the recommendations of the various global, federal and local health organizations.
- We've added 2 weeks additional paid sick-leave.
- We're monitoring our key vendors operational plans.

We will continue to monitor the health of our communities and organization and update this page if we make further changes.
