# Service Level Agreement

_Last updated: December 16, 2024_


This Redocly Service Level Agreement (**“SLA”**) is incorporated by reference in the Redocly Subscription Agreement located at https://redocly.com/subscription-agreement (the **“Redocly Agreement”**). Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the terms of the Redocly Agreement and capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings specified in the Redocly Agreement. Redocly reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the Redocly Agreement.


### Service Commitment

Redocly will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make the Cloud Products available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least 99.9% and (ii) maintain a Response Time (defined below) of 24 hours or less (collectively, the “Service Commitment”). In the event Redocly does not meet the Service Commitment, Customer may request that Redocly create and provide Customer with a Corrective Action Plan (defined below), and Redocly will do so within seven days of receiving Customer’s request. Requests for a Corrective Action Plan must be made within seven (7) days following the end of the month in which the Service Commitment was not met. Redocly shall implement the Corrective Action Plan in the time frames and manner set forth therein at no cost to Customer.

### Definitions

- **“Corrective Action Plan”** means, at a minimum: (a) Redocly’s commitment to Customer to devote the appropriate time, skilled personnel, systems support and equipment and other resources necessary to resolve and prevent any further occurrences of the errors giving rise to the support requests; (b) a strategy for developing any programming, software updates, fixes, patches, etc. necessary to remedy, and prevent any further occurrences of, the errors, and (c) time frames for implementing such strategy.

- **“Downtime”** is calculated as the total number of minutes in each calendar month that the entire applicable Cloud Product is Unavailable, other than as a result of an Exclusion set forth below.

    - Labor Day (first Monday of September);
    - Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday of November); and
    - Christmas Day (December 25).

- **“Monthly Uptime Percentage”** is calculated in respect of the applicable Cloud Product for each calendar month using the following formula: (minutes in the relevant month minus Downtime / minutes in the relevant month) x 100.

It is measured as the average time to respond to the support emails sent by Customer for the billing cycle, from the time the email was sent rounded up to the nearest normal business hour (Monday through Friday 9am to 5pm Central Time and excluding Holidays).

The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of any Products, or any other Redocly performance issues, that result from: (i) factors outside of Redocly’s reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Redocly; (ii) any actions or inactions of Customer or any third party; (iii) Customer’s equipment, software or other technology and/or third-party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within Redocly’s direct control); (iv) Redocly’s suspension or termination of Customer’s right to use such Products in accordance with the Redocly Agreement; (v) exceeding usage limits stated in the Redocly documentation; (vi) using the Product(s) in a way that is not recommended; (vii) Scheduled Maintenance; or (viii) making unauthorized modifications to such Product (collectively, the **“Exclusions”**).
